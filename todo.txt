    * Make liquid have a 50/50 chance of going left/right if both are possible
2. Tempature overhaul
    * Redo Cryotheum to be more interesting
    * Different heat conductivity per particle type
3. More particle types
    * Gasses
    * Move WetSand into extra_data for sand?
    * Make Plant look/behave more interesting
    * Quantum "portal" particles


1. Prettier rendering (Shaders, don't use the noise effect as much / better noise effect, heat haze blur?)
2. Physics based movement
3. Liquids/Gas pressure (with rendering effects)


1. Visualize axis lock controls and particle placement
2. Figure out why line drawing sometimes leaves gaps
3. Display the sandbox at 2X the size
4 GUI
5. Wasm
