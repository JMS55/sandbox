## Immediate Todo
1. More particle types
    * Fire
    * Add Metal (heat blood), Coal, and Steel
    * Quantum "portal" particles
2. Add some kind of background (maybe cache noise from a few frames ago, and use that with a different scaling?)

## Later Todo
1. Make Plant look better and grow in a more interesting pattern (also add comments)
2. Make particles move left/right randomly when they can do either
3. Figure out why axis lock sometimes breaks
4. Resizing the window too small crashes
5. Fix Electricity getting stuck with 1 particle of water in mid-air
6. Make Electricity have a much lower noise when not in water

## Eventual Todo
1. Animate Unstable explosion, maybe leave a particle/visual behind?
2. Visualize axis lock controls, particle placement, paused gameplay, etc
3. Save/Load simulations with files
4 GUI
5. Plan out gameplay progression. Start with a limited set of elements, create new ones to unlock them
6. App icon and package
